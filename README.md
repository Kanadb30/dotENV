## Why dotENV?

Managing environment variables shouldn't be a security risk or a collaboration nightmare. Traditional methods like sharing `.env` files over Slack or using unencrypted text files are prone to leaks. Enterprise solutions can be complex and expensive.

**dotENV strikes the perfect balance.** It offers military-grade encryption with a developer-friendly interface, ensuring your secrets are safe and accessible only to those who need them.

### Key Qualities

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
  We can't see your secrets even if we wanted to. Your master password never leaves your browser. Encryption happens client-side using **AES-256-GCM** and **PBKDF2**.

- **🚀 Developer-First Workflow**
  Import your existing `.env` files in seconds. Manage secrets with a familiar key-value interface. Export decyrpted files ready for production.

- **🎨 Professional UI**
  A clean, distraction-free dark mode interface inspired by modern developer tools like Vercel and Supabase. No clutter, just your projects.

- **⚡ Blazing Fast**
  Built on Next.js 14 and Supabase, dotENV is optimized for speed. Instant updates, smooth transitions, and responsive design.
